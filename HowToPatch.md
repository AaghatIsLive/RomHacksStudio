2. Extract the downloaded file using a program such as [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html).

3. Download an original Pokemon Emerald ROM, if you do not already have it.

4. Go to [RomPatcher.js](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/).

5. In the `Rom` section, select the original Pokemon Emerald ROM.

6. In the `Patch` section, select the extracted Emerald Crest patch file.

7. Click on `Apply Patch` and the process is complete. Enjoy the game! ðŸ˜€

> The patch file should end with `.bps` or `.ups` after extraction. If it doesn't, you may have missed a step. Also, after patching the game should end with `.gba`, if it ends with `.txt`, then just remove `.txt` by renaming the file.
