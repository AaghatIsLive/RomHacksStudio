# How to Patch

## PC

1. Download the Pokemon Emerald Crest patch file from [our releases page](#release).

2. Extract the downloaded file using a program such as [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html).

3. Download the original Pokemon Emerald ROM, if you do not already have it.

4. Go to [RomPatcher.js](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/).

5. In the 'Rom' section, select the original Pokemon Emerald ROM.

6. In the 'Patch' section, select the extracted Emerald Crest patch file.

   **NOTE:** The patch file should end with .bps or .ups after extraction. If it doesn't, you may have missed a step. Also, after patching the game should end with .gba, if it ends with .txt, then just remove .txt by renaming the file.

7. Click on 'Apply Patch' and the process is complete. Enjoy the game! :grinning:
